To install the `psy-transect` package, we recommend that
you first install the :ref:`requirements for pyinterp <pyinterp:requirements>`
and then install it from PyPi via::

    pip install psy-transect

Or install it directly from `the source code repository on Gitlab`_ via::

    pip install git+https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/psyplot/psy-transect.git

The latter should however only be done if you want to access the development
versions.
